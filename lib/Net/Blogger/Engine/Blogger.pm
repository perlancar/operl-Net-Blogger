=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

=over 4

=item *

B<Delays>

It remains uncertain how long a program needs to wait between the time that a new
post is submitted to the Blogger servers and that that may post may be acted upon.

The applies to the Blogger API I<getPost>, I<editPost> and I<deletePost> methods equally.
Anything under a 10 second will often result in a "post not found" fault. A delay of 10
seconds or more is usually successful. Your mileage may vary.

=item *

B<setTemplate()>

 <quote src = "ev">
  There are some blogs for which setTemplate will return a permission denied error. Newly
  created blogs will work. Sufficiently older blogs will work. A meanwhile work-around:
  edit the template through Blogger UI first.
