=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<DEPRECATION NOTICE.> This module no longer works and is deprecated. In fact,
as of this writing (2020-10-19), none of the CPAN modules for Blogger (including
WebService::Blogger) currently work.

Blogger.pm provides an OOP-ish interface for accessing a weblog
via the Blogger XML-RPC API.

=head1 ENGINES

Blogger.pm relies on "engines" to implement it's functionality.
The Blogger.pm package itself is little more than a wrapper file
that happens to use a default "Blogger" engine is none other is
specified.

   my $manila = Net::Blogger->new(engine=>"manila");

But wait!, you say. It's an API that servers implements and all I should have to
do is changed the login data. Why do I need an engine?

Indeed. Every server pretty much gets the spirit of the API right, but each implements
the details slightly differently. For example :

The MovableType XML-RPC server follows the spec for the I<getRecentPost> but because of
the way Perl auto-vivifies hashes it turns out you can slurp all the posts for a blog
rather than the just the 20 most recent.

The Userland Manila server doesn't support the I<getUsersBlogs> method; the Userland
RadioUserland server does.

The Blogger server imposes a limit on the maximum length of a post. Other servers don't.
(Granted the server in question will return a fault, if necessary, but Blogger.pm tries
to do the right thing and check for these sorts of things before adding to the traffic
on the network.)

Lots of weblog-like applications don't support the Blogger API but do have a traditional
REST interface. With the introduction of Blogger.pm "engines", support for these applications
via the API can be added with all the magic happening behind the curtain, so to speak.

this writing, the Text::Outline package has not been uploaded to the CPAN. See below for
a link to the homepage/source.

sub DESTROY {
    return 1;

    $AUTOLOAD =~ s/.*:://;
    return $self->{"_class"}->$AUTOLOAD(@_);
}

=head1 NOTES

=head2 The Atom API

In January 2004, Blogger announced their support for the Atom
API.

As of this writing (version 0.87) this package does B<not>
support the Atom API. If you need to do things Atom-ish, your
best bet is to use the L<XML::Atom> package.

=head2 Content negotiation

Persons trying to connect to a server using shortened URLs and
content negotiation should not be surprised if they encounter
weirdness and/or errors. Specifically, a HTTP 406 error.

Some preliminary investigation suggests that, if there's a bug
at play here, it's a bug somewhere deep in SOAP::Lite/HTTP::*
land.

Patches are welcome. Otherwise, you've been warned. :-)
